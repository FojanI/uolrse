# Solution 4

This project requires Tweeter (now X) and Meta APIs for data collection. Both these companies provide different end points which allows retrieve data and metadata and filter them. The response to successful request will be a JSON object that can be simply converted to data frames. There are also built-in libraries in a variety of different programming languages that can be used to call Twitter and Facebook APIs.

- What is the main goal of this research and collecting this data? Understanding the research objective is fundamental to shaping the requirements.

- What is the target population for data collection? This is important because either specific individuals might be the target of this study or a random sample is to be collected in which case a wide range of complementary questions need to be considered. For example:
	- Is the target population representative for the purposes of the study?
	- Does the target sample need to have a minimum number of followers?
	- What are the mechanisms to identify specific groups of individuals? 
	- These are important questions because it could affect the data collection process and is also instrumental to the study itself.

- How large should the sample be? This is to ensure the collected data is statistically sufficient to be able to address the main research questions.

- Do we need to collect the data in a specific language or is this going to be multilingual? The question is crucial for guiding the selection of appropriate tools, ensuring accurate data analysis, and allocating resources effectively based on whether the data collection is language-specific or multilingual.

- What are the required attributes or features to be recorded (tweets, comments, likes, shares)? This is important for the study as it can help addressing the key research questions of the study. It is also important from a technical data collection and storage perspective. Also, some crucial data for the study may not be directly available from the API and might have to be collected from secondary sources.

- What sort of processing need to be applied to data? This is important as it outlines what kind of analysis needs to be applied to the data. These may include sentiment analysis, network analysis, or any other form of data and statistical analysis.

- Do we anticipate a large volume of data? Knowing the expected scale helps in designing a system that can handle the load.

- What are the storage requirements and where does the data going to be stored? It is important to choose a secure and scalable storage solution based on the volume and sensitivity of the data. This could partially be determined based on an earlier question about the sample size.

- What are the user interface design and data visualisation requirements? This is important from both software design as well as output dissemination requirements.

- How long the collected project data is to be retained? This is important for a clear data retention policy and to compliance with privacy regulations.

- What are the budgeting and resource requirements for this project? This helps getting a sense of the project scope and the available budget matches the required level of technical support.

- What is the time frame of the research project? The time frame affects the choice of tools and the overall project plan.

- How do you plan to address ethical concerns? This is critical for ensuring responsible and ethical research practices and data handling.
